This class is multi-generational and is open to all levels of athletic ability, from beginner to experienced. Everyone will be challenged, encouraged and supported in their movement research. We will explore movement through drills, games and partner work.<\/p> <p><br\/>The group will meet on Wednesdays from 6:30-8 and sessions are completely free of charge.<\/p>",

The practice is about developing an understanding of our bodies and how we can build a practice that will support us in our lives and give us the tools to age well and in grace.<\/p> <p><br\/>The focus of this class is to introduce and bring awareness to a different approach to fitness and how one can become fit, stay fit and promote a lifestyle that is counter to the modern approach to movement. This class is multi-generational and is open to all levels of athletic ability, from beginner to experienced. Everyone will be challenged, encouraged and supported in their movement research. We will explore movement through drills, games and partner work.<\/p> <p><br\/>The group will meet on Wednesdays from 6:30-8 and sessions are completely free of charge.<\/p>",

This class is multi-generational and is open to all levels of athletic ability, from beginner to experienced. Everyone will be challenged, encouraged and supported in their movement research. We will explore movement through drills, games and partner work.<\/p> <p><br\/>The group will meet on Wednesdays from 6:30-8 and sessions are completely free of charge.<\/p>",

This class is multi-generational and is open to all levels of athletic ability, from beginner to experienced. Everyone will be challenged, encouraged and supported in their movement research. We will explore movement through drills, games and partner work.<\/p> <p><br\/>The group will meet on Wednesdays from 6:30-8 and sessions are completely free of charge.<\/p>",

This class is multi-generational and is open to all levels of athletic ability, from beginner to experienced. Everyone will be challenged, encouraged and supported in their movement research. We will explore movement through drills, games and partner work.<\/p> <p><br\/>The group will meet on Wednesdays from 6:30-8 and sessions are completely free of charge.<\/p>",

This class is multi-generational and is open to all levels of athletic ability, from beginner to experienced. Everyone will be challenged, encouraged and supported in their movement research. We will explore movement through drills, games and partner work.<\/p> <p><br\/>The group will meet on Wednesdays from 6:30-8 and sessions are completely free of charge.<\/p>",

This class is multi-generational and is open to all levels of athletic ability, from beginner to experienced. Everyone will be challenged, encouraged and supported in their movement research. We will explore movement through drills, games and partner work.<\/p> <p><br\/>The group will meet on Wednesdays from 6:30-8 and sessions are completely free of charge.<\/p>",

The practice is about developing an understanding of our bodies and how we can build a practice that will support us in our lives and give us the tools to age well and in grace.<\/p> <p><br\/>The focus of this class is to introduce and bring awareness to a different approach to fitness and how one can become fit, stay fit and promote a lifestyle that is counter to the modern approach to movement. This class is multi-generational and is open to all levels of athletic ability, from beginner to experienced. Everyone will be challenged, encouraged and supported in their movement research. We will explore movement through drills, games and partner work.<\/p> <p><br\/>The group will meet on Wednesdays from 6:30-8 and sessions are completely free of charge.<\/p>",

The practice is about developing an understanding of our bodies and how we can build a practice that will support us in our lives and give us the tools to age well and in grace.<\/p> <p><br\/>The focus of this class is to introduce and bring awareness to a different approach to fitness and how one can become fit, stay fit and promote a lifestyle that is counter to the modern approach to movement. This class is multi-generational and is open to all levels of athletic ability, from beginner to experienced. Everyone will be challenged, encouraged and supported in their movement research. We will explore movement through drills, games and partner work.<\/p> <p><br\/>The group will meet on Wednesdays from 6:30-8 and sessions are completely free of charge.<\/p>",
